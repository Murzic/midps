MIDPS lab#1 and lab#2
=====
##Ungureanu Eugeniu

I started with installing VirtualBox and creating a new machine. After some of failed attempts of connecting using SSH, I've finally managed to do it. I've installed Ubuntu on the virtual machine, on it I installed git, openssh, c, c++. After this, I compiled the c and c++ hello-world programs and played a little bit with git, i.e. created some branches, commited to them, set a remote origin, merged branches and reset commits to previous state. So I've managed to do all the tasks for the first laboratory including the "Advanced level".
For the second part of the lab, I've used vim to write the script that compiles two Hello World programs using BASH. One was c++ and the other was c. Then I've modified it to output the result if the program compiles. If not, then it outputs the error that interfered with the compilation.

##Conclusions
The first lab was a refreshing to my git knowledge, because I was already initiated about it in my Windows programming laboratory classes. The second one was something new for me, because I'd never written a script before and now I've got some idea of how all this works. The tasks I've done were pretty easy, but were somehow interesting for me.
