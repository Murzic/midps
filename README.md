MIDPS lab#1 and lab#2
=====
##Ungureanu Eugeniu

I started with installing VirtualBox and creating a new machine. After some of failed attempts of connecting using SSH, I've finally managed to do it. I've installed Ubuntu on the virtual machine, on it I installed git, openssh, c, c++. After this, I compiled the c and c++ hello-world programs and played a little bit with git, i.e. created some branches, commited to them, set a remote origin, merged branches and reset commits to previous state. So I've managed to do all the tasks for the first laboratory including the "Advanced level".


##Conclusions
The first lab was a refreshing to my git knowledge, because I was already initiated about it in my Windows programming laboratory classes.
